## data sources
the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics records the Consumer Price Index (CPI) monthly.
this can be used to generally determine the value of the US Dollar relative to other times.
specifically, this program uses the `cu.data.1.AllItems` file under the "All Urban Consumers" CPI database which can be found [here](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) in "Text File" format.
the `data_process.py` program takes this file (named `data.txt` in this repo for brevity) and outputs a C array containing the average of the monthly CPI values for each year.
